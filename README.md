This repository contains the code needed for a Chrome Extension called "WI$E". This project was designed for the McHacks 2024 hackathon at McGill. 

The purpose of this Chrome Extension is to moderate a user's online shopping, in the goal of promoting reasonable personal spendings and local sustainable 
businesses in Montreal. 

When visiting various shopping websites, this extension sends a pop-up message that prompts the user to answer a series of questions. If the user decides 
that their purchase is impulsive, unreasonable or useless, they are automatically redirected to the Google Browser.  If the user decides to continue with 
their purchase, the extension will encourage them to shop at local sustainable bussinesses instead.

To utilize this Chrome Extension, a user must download this extension directory from this repository, and then access their "Extensions" page on 
Google Chrome. From there, they must click the "Load Unpacked" button and upload the extension directory. The extension can then be pinned to the user's 
Chrome browser, and will work on selected shopping websites.
